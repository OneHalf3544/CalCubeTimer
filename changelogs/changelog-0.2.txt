+Scramble view didn't resize properly when closed then opened
+X (close) button for server connect doesn't actually cancel as it should
+details buttons changed
+nullpointer deleting lots of times with right click
+faq - stackmat value!!
+Me again... I put in edit time for one of my solves and then when I hit enter, the timer started.  Just letting you know... -> shift key should be ignored -> ENTER is now ignored
+defaults to scramble view enabled
+complete documentation of all features
+resizable fix for server scrambles

+keyboard timer in linux <--> stop timer bug if delay not over
+bigcube scramble options (editable jcombobox?)
+scramble length options

+splits are now properly ignored
+click on cube colors for color selection
+need to test server scrambles again
+ServerScrambleList probably needs to be changed, since there is now an infinite
number of scrambles (not to mention lengths)
+clients can only request scrambles of the default length
+Configuration rehaul:
	+properties files for configuration
	+improved configurationdialog speed by not remaking it everytime
	+save all options regarding scrambles (size of scramble view, type, length)
	+staticized!
+bug: choosing importing from file, then pressing cancel discarded current scrambles
+multi-slice gui option
+public static final string CCT_VERSION added to CCT.java
+scramble subscripts for 6x6x6+
+change program to save everything upon exiting, not continuously
+config option: label password field more clearly
+there are bugs with switching types of scramble midway through an average, how should it behave?  I decided to prompt the user, and then throw out the old scrambles
+create a modal dialog box to guify scramble type, length (optional), multislice.
 This solves these two problems:
	+options for exporting scrambles (type, length, multislice)
	+how should importing should do a better job of handling scramble types
+save size and position of both windows
+gui idea - merge timer display, keyboard timer, and stackmat settings thingy?
+request scrambles on server? (/3, /4, /5..?)
+clicking "X" after clicking "email"
+use only spacebar to start option

+gui-fy Ryan's inversion options
+prompt user when choosing import scrambles, but already using server scrambles
